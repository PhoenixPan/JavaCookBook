# Bit representation and operations

1 and 0: true or false  
8 bit = 1 byte


int 4 bytes
int index = 1;
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
int has 32 bits, the first digit is sign bit (positive or negative), therefore, the maximum number we can represent is:  
[sign] 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^29 + 2^30  
Totally, the limit of int is 2^31




123 = 10^0 * 3 + 10^1 * 2 + 10^2 * 1
